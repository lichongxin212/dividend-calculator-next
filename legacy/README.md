## Calculations

### Stock Dividend Yield
Dividend yield is calculated by dividing the total dividends paid over the past 12 months by the current stock price.

Example:
- Annual dividends: $2
- Current stock price: $50
- Dividend yield: ($2/$50) × 100% = 4%

### Portfolio Dividend Yield
Portfolio dividend yield is calculated by dividing the total annual dividend income by the total portfolio value.

Example:
- Portfolio value: $10,000
- Annual dividend income: $400
- Portfolio yield: ($400/$10,000) × 100% = 4%

### Monthly Dividends
Monthly dividend distribution is based on actual ex-dividend dates from the past 12 months. Only includes dividends that have already been paid to provide accurate income projections.
